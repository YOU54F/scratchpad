## Use

You can perform searches against [Pact documentation](https://docs.pact.io)  & [Pactflow documentation](https://docs.pactflow.io) without installing `pactman` permanently

```shell
npx pactman
```
  - select which site you want to search ["pact","pactflow"]
  - type search query
  - click/Press Enter on the desired result to open the browser

Or you can install `pactman` globally to be quicker

```shell
npm i -g pactman
```

```shell
pactman
```
